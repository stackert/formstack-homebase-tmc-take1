## Overview Web (Form Builder )

This appears to be a modern React/TypeScript application with a well-organized, modular architecture. The builder module follows a typical structure with:

- `components/` - React components
- `store/` - State management (likely Redux or similar)
- `route/` - Routing configuration
- `constants/` - Shared constants and configurations
- Testing support with `__mocks__/`

The codebase seems to follow a feature-based directory structure, where each major feature (forms, workflows, portals, etc.) is contained in its own directory with its components, logic, and resources. This makes the codebase more maintainable and allows for better separation of concerns.

The presence of features like analytics, workflows, and portals suggests this is an enterprise-grade form building platform with advanced capabilities beyond simple form creation, including form deployment, workflow automation, and detailed analytics.

The `src` directory appears to be a sophisticated **form-building** and management platform. Let me break down the main areas of functionality:

1. **Core Form Functionality**

   - `builder/` - The form builder interface where users create forms
   - `live-form/` - The runtime/display version of forms for end-users
   - `forms-list/` - Form management and listing interface
   - `forms-analytics/` - Analytics and reporting for form submissions
   - `form-settings/` and `form-settings-menu/` - Configuration and settings for forms
   - `form-share/` - Sharing and collaboration features
   - `submissions/` - Handling form submission data

2. **Portal & Workspace Management**

   - `workspace/` - Main workspace environment
   - `portals/` and `portal-view/` - Portal functionality for form deployment
   - `portals-upsell/` - Premium features marketing for portal functionality

3. **Workflow Features**

   - `workflow-editor/` - Interface for creating form workflows
   - `workflow-preview/` - Preview functionality for workflows

4. **Account & User Management**

   - `account-settings/` and `account-settings-menu/` - User account management
   - `account-plan/` and `account-plan-matrix/` - Subscription and pricing plans
   - `onboarding/` - New user onboarding experience

5. **UI & Navigation Components**

   - `main-header/` - Main navigation header
   - `form-navigation-bar/` - Form-specific navigation
   - `dashboard/` - Main user dashboard interface

6. **Integration & Add-ons**

   - `addons/` - Extension and plugin system
   - `fs-api/` - File system API integration
   - `conversion-kit/` - Tools for data conversion/transformation

7. **Utility & Common Components**

   - `common/` - Shared components and utilities
   - `froala-rendering-styles/` - Rich text editor styling

8. **Security & Configuration**
   - `captcha-domains-dialog/` - CAPTCHA configuration
   - `confirm-subdomain-dialog/` - Domain management
