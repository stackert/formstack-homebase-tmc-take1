## Overview

Based on the search results, here's a concise overview:

This is Formstack's core form rendering library that provides multiple ways to display and interact with Formstack forms across different platforms. In common language, This is the application that is responsible for presenting form to the end-user (public).

The library supports various embedding methods including JavaScript snippets, npm package integration, single-page applications, and static HTML generation. It features a modular architecture that handles form state management, multiple authentication methods (password protection, SSO, workflow resume encryption), and supports both hosted (by Formstack) and self-hosted deployments. The forms can be rendered with different authentication levels, customized themes, and can operate in various modes including kiosk mode, one-question-at-a-time surveys, and with partial submission support.

# Directory Structure

Let me check the root directory structure:

Ran tool

Yes, there are several important sibling directories to 'packages':

Key source/build directories:

- `schemas/` - Contains schema definitions
- `static/` - Static assets
- `test/` - Test files
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `builds/` - Build outputs

Supporting directories:

- `docs/` - Generated documentation
- `coverage/` - Test coverage reports

Development/tooling directories:

- `.github/` - GitHub workflows and configurations
- `.husky/` - Git hooks
- `.vscode/` - VS Code settings

The most important directories for understanding the codebase structure appear to be:

1. `packages/` - Main source code
2. `schemas/` - Schema definitions
3. `static/` - Static assets
4. `test/` - Test files
5. `config/` - Configuration

The `schemas/` directory contains the source schemas and generated type definitions, which would be important for understanding the core data structures used throughout the codebase.
