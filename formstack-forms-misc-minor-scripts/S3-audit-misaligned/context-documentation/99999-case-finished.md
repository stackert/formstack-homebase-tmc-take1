# Concluding Remarks

## To use

cd into the working directory (contains package.json)
run `npm install` to install the dependencies
run `npm run start` to run the script

## To extend

The script is well documented and should be easy to extend.

Simply open the project in Cursor/Composer, drag directory 'context-documentation' into the composer window and have a conversation. I would recommend ice breakers "Can you tell me what this does" or "I have an S3 Report I need your help with. I have a list of forms with their names in one file, I have an S3 report, I need summary of the 10 biggest forms by storage usage, then need to be referenced by their name and not formId".

The Objective is not to build a bigger better script, the objective is to build a disposable script that suites your needs.

When this script was created the input file name was known and hard-coded. You'll likely need to instruct Cursor/Composer to fix the name (recommended), fix it yourself (less recommended), or use the same name (least recommend).
