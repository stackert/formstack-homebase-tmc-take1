Based on the files I've reviewed, I can tell you that the script is using the following field IDs (which are soft-coded as constants at the top of the script):
1. FIELD_ID_SOURCE = "180770306" - This is the source field (Short Answer) that will be monitored for input
FIELD_ID_TARGET_EVEN = "180770343" - This is where even numbers will be copied to
FIELD_ID_TARGET_ODD = "180770330" - This is where odd numbers will be copied to
