## Approach #2

### Pre-requisites

- Please review `context-documentation/00100-proposed-solution-take1.md` I think it will be helpful to understand what not to do.

- write the script to artifacts/embed-code.html, You should replace `<script>...</script>` with the script that will accomplish the objective.

- See `artifacts/fsFeApi/00000-context-document-fsApi.md` for the code snippets that make create examples of your output. **IMPORTANT**: This includes code snippets that we should use as a pattern for our solution. There are some comments that are important to include.

- See `artifacts/fsFeApi/*` for more general background and interesting read. (not so important for us)

### Things that are different.

- We are creating a dedicated project for this task. All the files within the root of the project are related to this specific task.
- We recognize the need for more specific example 'Look at [artifacts/fsFeApi/00000-context-document-fsApi.md], use that pattern to accomplish our objective defined in [context-documentation/00000-case-open.md]'
