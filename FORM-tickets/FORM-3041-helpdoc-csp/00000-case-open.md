# FORM\-3041 - Document Live Form resources for customer Content Security Policy

Description

Work with Ryan Jorgensen @Ryan Jorgensen to create a Forms V4-specific help article for customers that want to embed their forms in their website, and their site includes a CSP.

It might be similar to this article for Salesforce: https://help.formstack.com/s/article/Updating-Your-Content-Security-Policy-for-Forms

On our side:

find out the correct settings we need for CSP

Probably talk to Gabriel about this

Include future settings for the new Analytics endpoint

Work with Ryan to gather any additional information he needs

#### FORM-3046 -

FORM-3041 Is associated with rejected ticket FORM-3046, which has more details.

```
We should have a CSP doc for Forms that tells customers the correct settings that they’ll need to have in order to fix CSP issues. We think it can also help with our customer communications when we’re asking them to update their CSP for any changes that we may be making (such as analytics).



I have worked with Ryan Jorgensen on at least one previous help doc. I don’t know the flow/process to get a new help doc done, but I’m sure we can ask him.
