Looking at the recently viewed files, I see there's a submission log for 1298223112 from December 18, 2024. Let me analyze that one.

Based on the logs, here's the chronological profile of submission 1298223112 (the one having issues):

2024-12-18 07:32:10 - Initial submission created for Purchase Ordering Form - SVAHS
2024-12-18 07:32:10 - System begins processing submission
2024-12-18 07:32:10 - Email prepared for delivery to mparks@smithtec.org requesting approval
2024-12-18 07:32:11 - Email successfully sent to mparks@smithtec.org
2024-12-18 09:02:54 - Submission approval record created (ID: 35695943) for user 892760
2024-12-18 (multiple attempts) - Mike Parks attempts to approve the submission through the email link

- Multiple GET requests to `/admin/submission/approve/1298223112` with approval hash
- All requests coming from IP 50.232.51.126
- Using MacOS 10.15.7 with Chrome browser

Key Observations:

1. The submission was created and initial processing worked correctly
2. The approval email was successfully delivered to Mike Parks
3. Mike Parks attempted to approve multiple times through the email link
4. The system created an approval record but something appears to have gone wrong with the actual approval process
5. There are multiple attempts to access the approval URL, suggesting the approver was having difficulty completing the action
6. The approval attempts were made through email links (fromEmail=true in the logs)
7. The user was not logged in during approval attempts (isLoggedIn=false)

The logs show that while the initial submission and email delivery worked correctly, there appears to be an issue with the actual approval process when Mike Parks tried to approve through the email link. This matches with the case note that indicates this submission "did NOT work as expected".

Based on the logs, here's what we can determine about the approval:

1. The approval record (ID: 35695943) was created at 2024-12-18 09:02:54
2. The record shows it was assigned to user ID 892760
3. Mike Parks (mparks@smithtec.org) attempted to approve the submission multiple times
4. However, there's no clear evidence in the logs of a successful approval completion

Looking at the SQL record:

```sql
(35695943, 1298223112, 892760, 1, 1, 0, 0, '2024-12-18 09:02:54', 4742610, NULL)
```

The zeros in positions 6 and 7 suggest the approval was not successfully completed (these typically represent approval status flags).

So while Mike Parks attempted to approve the submission multiple times around 09:02:54 on December 18, 2024, it appears the approval process did not complete successfully. The system created an approval record but the actual approval action seems to have failed to complete.
