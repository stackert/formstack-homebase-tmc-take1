Expected Behavior: When the form language is set to Slovak, the "Drag and drop" text remains in English. The customer requires this text to be localized into Slovak as well. Below is the requested translation.

Maximálna veľkosť súboru: 14 MB”

Actual Behavior: The language does not translate.
Steps to Recreate: Allen T: I’ve followed the steps taken by the customer and can confirm their observation. When the form language is set to Slovak, the "Drag and drop" text in the file upload field remains in English. However, when the form language is set to Slovenian, it translates correctly.

Steps to Resolve: Allen: Tried adding the Google Translate widget, but even when selecting Slovak, the language does not change to Slovak.
