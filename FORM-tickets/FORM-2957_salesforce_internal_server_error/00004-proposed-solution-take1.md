# Proposed Solution Take 1, Multiple File Upload support for Salesforce Submit Action

## Initial Approach

We will gather the following documentations/examples:

- json Form definition (API GET form/id)
- database SubmitAction definition for this submit actions
- I will map two fields:
  1. control File field. The ideal set-up we know to work (configured for single file only)
  2. a field that we will work on/with (configured to allow configured data)
- I will provide the Salesforce API and perhaps references to any other Salesforce Integration files (those should have already been discovered and only useful for references).

## Concluding Remarks
