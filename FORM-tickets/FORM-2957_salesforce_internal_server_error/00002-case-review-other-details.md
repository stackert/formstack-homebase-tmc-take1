Regarding the submission-data, field missing. There may be a reasonable explanation unknown to us. The customer may have deleted the field after the fact and therefore it is no longer a part of the form, therefore no longer part of the submission data. Its unfortunate for use because it may add insights.

I will tell you we used to have a simple file upload field that handle one file at a time, we now support multiple files, which is likely the cause of this issue. If we need to, we can create a multiple file submission example for a different form.
