After reviewing the logs and the submission,

It appears when there are intermittent failures pushing files to Sharepoint it corresponds to submissions with 50MB+ of file uploads. There are only about 20 submission in the past month so there isn't a lot to go on. Because the files are being moved via webhook and not file integration (so we retain the files), I do not consider this as 'critical' at this time.
