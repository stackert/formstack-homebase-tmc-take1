### Slack Notes

<@arthur tapang> Is requesting assistance on this ticket: https://formstack.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500Vu00000HM8zhIAD/view?ws=%2Flightning%2Fr%2FAccount%2F0014w000043g0jGAAQ%2Fview
\*Here is the Form Id: 5593268
Here is the issue they're trying to solve:
Customer reports about their submission's File Uploads were not pushing to their SharePoint via PowerAutomate. The submission view shows the Submit Action is Pending. Related submission ID shows SUMO logs of the attempt and failure (please see the thread below)
Would appreciate any insights or advice on this matter :keanu-thanks:
Troubleshooting steps taken or team that they think may need to get involved:

- discovered customer's account doesn't have API Access feature, is this it the main culprit?
- suggested that it is possible that it was not working as intended due to Forms API Access not being activated on their account (see screenshot below)
- pricing sheet shows Suite Starter (legacy) doesn't include and is not eligible for API add-on
- cx denied not having the feature above and mentioned subscribing to "Formstack Connector" but had no idea where/what to check
  Impersonation access granted Yes
  Email or Org ID associated with impersonation access: systems_dhcf@dhchenfoundation.com  
  Please take a look at this and see if you can help. If not, please respond in a thread so that they know to go ahead and escalate the ticket.
